# Orders Context

The lifecycle and business rules for cash-on-delivery orders in Algeria.

## Language

### Core Entities

**Order**:
A customer's request to purchase products with payment collected at delivery.
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction, sale

**Order Number**:
Human-readable identifier shown to customer and merchant (format: `ORD-20260824-0042`).
_Avoid_: Order ID (that's the UUID), reference number

**COD Amount**:
Total cash the courier collects from the customer = product price + delivery fee.
_Avoid_: Total, amount due, collection amount

**Customer**:
The person receiving and paying for the order at their address.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, end user

### Lifecycle States

**New**:
Order just created, not yet confirmed by merchant.
_Avoid_: Pending, created, draft

**Confirmed**:
Merchant approved the order and will prepare it for delivery.
_Avoid_: Accepted, validated, approved

**Preparing**:
Order confirmed and being prepared by merchant (packing products, quality check).
_Avoid_: In preparation, processing, packing

**Ready**:
Order is prepared and available for assignment or dispatch.
_Avoid_: Prepared, available, staged

**Assigned**:
Order has a driver allocated for manual delivery. This is reached when a driver is assigned to a ready order.
_Avoid_: Allocated, booked

**Note:** Driver assignment sets the `driverId` property and can happen from `ready` status. The `assigned` status indicates the order is with the driver.

**Dispatched**:
Order handed to a delivery company and has a tracking number.
_Avoid_: Shipped, sent, transferred

**Out for Delivery**:
Courier is actively attempting delivery to the customer.
_Avoid_: In transit, en route, delivering

**Delivered**:
Customer received the order and paid the COD amount.
_Avoid_: Completed, fulfilled, closed

**Returned**:
Customer refused the order at the door; products returned to merchant.
_Avoid_: Rejected, cancelled by customer, refunded

**Cancelled**:
Order terminated before delivery (by merchant or system).
_Avoid_: Deleted, voided, rejected

**Test Order**:
An order created from a test-mode product or landing page — a validation experiment run before any stock exists. It lives in its own isolated view, is refused by dispatch and driver assignment, and is excluded from live analytics until it is promoted to a real order.
_Avoid_: Fake order, sample order, draft order

**Unreachable**:
Customer didn't answer phone attempts; order parked for retry.
_Avoid_: No answer, failed contact, suspended

### Delivery Methods

**Manual Delivery**:
Merchant's own driver delivers the order.
_Avoid_: Self-delivery, internal delivery, direct delivery

**Company Delivery**:
Order dispatched to a third-party carrier (NOEST, Yalidine, ZR Express, EcoTrack).
_Avoid_: External delivery, carrier delivery, outsourced

**Stop Desk**:
Customer picks up from a carrier's collection point instead of home delivery.
_Avoid_: Pickup point, collection center, self-pickup

### Operations

**Dispatch**:
The act of creating a shipment with a delivery company via their API.
_Avoid_: Ship, send, transmit

**Tracking Number**:
The carrier's unique identifier for the shipment (e.g., `NE123456789DZ`).
_Avoid_: Waybill number, AWB, shipment ID

**Validation**:
Carrier confirmation that the shipment is accepted and ready for pickup.
_Avoid_: Approval, verification, acceptance

**Bulk Dispatch**:
Creating multiple shipments in one API call (up to 100 orders).
_Avoid_: Batch dispatch, mass dispatch, multi-dispatch

**Driver Assignment**:
Allocating a specific driver to an order for manual delivery.
_Avoid_: Driver allocation, assignment to driver

**Unassignment**:
Removing the driver from an order (allowed until out_for_delivery).
_Avoid_: Deallocation, removal, clearing driver

### Return Scenarios

**Full Return**:
All products in the order were refused by the customer.
_Avoid_: Complete return, total rejection

**Partial Return**:
Customer accepted some products and returned others at the door.
_Avoid_: Split delivery, selective acceptance

**Product Line Return**:
Recording how many units of a specific product were returned.
_Avoid_: Item return, SKU return

### Financial

**Delivery Fee**:
The cost charged to the customer for delivery service.
_Avoid_: Shipping fee, freight charge, transport cost

**Driver Fee**:
The amount paid to the driver for delivering the order.
_Avoid_: Driver commission, delivery payout, driver earnings

**Price**:
Product subtotal excluding the delivery fee.
_Avoid_: Product total, item cost, subtotal

### Algerian Specifics

**Wilaya**:
Algerian province (1-58); determines delivery zones and fees.
_Avoid_: State, region, province

**Commune**:
Municipality within a wilaya; precise delivery destination.
_Avoid_: City, municipality, district

**Home Delivery**:
Delivery to customer's residential address.
_Avoid_: Doorstep delivery, address delivery

**Open at Delivery**:
Cultural practice where customer inspects products before paying.
_Avoid_: COD inspection, delivery inspection

## Edge Cases

**Auto-customer creation**: If `customerId` doesn't exist (walk-in/manual), customer is created automatically using order data.

**Test orders never ship without promotion**: `is_test = 1` blocks both carrier dispatch and driver assignment. Promotion flips the flag on the same row (history intact) and is refused for non-test orders, already-dispatched orders, and terminal statuses.

**Double return safety**: Cancelling or returning an order multiple times is idempotent - inventory restores only once.

**Transition guards**: Status can only move forward in the flow (no delivered → new). System returns allowed transitions on invalid moves.

**Dispatch vs Assignment mutual exclusion**: Orders can be dispatched to a company OR assigned to a driver, never both. Attempting both returns 422.

**Bulk dispatch partial success**: If 5/10 orders dispatch successfully, returns 201 with per-order results (not 400).

**Validation timing**: EcoTrack requires validation before the shipment can progress; NOEST auto-validates on creation.
